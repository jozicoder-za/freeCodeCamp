      <h1>AI - An Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to
        perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks
        include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language
        understanding. AI mimics cognitive functions by analyzing data,
        identifying patterns, and making decisions with minimal human
        intervention.

        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Machine Learning is a core subset of AI where systems learn and
          improve from data automatically without being explicitly programmed.
          Algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, or decisions based on
          training data. Recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify), spam
          filters, fraud detection.

        <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
        <p>
          This field enables machines to "see" and interpret visual data
          (images, videos). AI algorithms extract information, recognize
          objects/faces, and understand scenes. Typical Examples include Facial
          recognition, medical image analysis, self-driving cars.

        <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
        <p>
          NLP allows machines to understand, interpret, and generate human
          language. It bridges communication between humans and computers using
          text or speech. Examples: Chatbots (like ChatGPT), translation apps,
          sentiment analysis.
