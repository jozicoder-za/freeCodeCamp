# Lunch Picker Program

Build a program that helps in managing lunch options. You'll work with an array of lunches, add and remove items from the array, and randomly select a lunch option.

### User Stories

1.  You should create a `lunches` variable and assign it an empty array that will be used to store lunch items.
2.  You should create a function `addLunchToEnd` that takes an array as the first argument and a string as the second argument. The function should:

- Add the string to the end of the array.
- Log the string `"[Lunch Item] added to the end of the lunch menu."` to the console, where `[Lunch Item]` is the string passed to the function.
- Return the updated array.

3.  You should create a function `addLunchToStart` that takes an array as the first argument and a string as the second argument. The function should:

- Add the string to the start of the array.
- Log the string `"[Lunch Item] added to the start of the lunch menu."` to the console, where `[Lunch Item]` is the string passed to the function.
- Return the updated array.
