## Build a Golf Score Translator

In the game of Gold, each hole has a `par`, meaning the average number of `strokes` a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below `par` your `strokes` are, there is a different nickname.

In the challenge you will write a function that converts the `par` and `strokes` to their nickname.

### Step 1

You should create a function named `golfScore`.

### Step 2

`golfScore` should take two numeric arguments, which are the par for the course and the amount of strokes made.

### Step 3

`golfScore` should return a string.

### Step 4

`golfScore` should return `"Hole-in-one!"` if `strokes` is `1`.
